SuperLevelOptimizer very easy to use. SuperLevelOptimizer combines meshes to reduce the number of draw calls.So, let's move to how to do it:

1) The object that you want to combine, put a flag in the field of static.

2) Create SuperLevelOptimizer. To do this, go to the "GameObject/Create Other/Super Level Optimizer" or "SuperLevelOptimizer/Create optimizer". Or use prefab in "SuperLevelOptimizer/SuperOptimizerPrefab/Super Level Optimizer.prefab".

3) If you want that the combined objects remained in prefab, at CombineState specify Combine To Prefab.

4) We created SuperLevelOptimizer. Click button : "Combine Meshes".

5) Next to remove the original objects, press button : "Destroy Sources".


Additionally : 

If you want to create prefab of any object, in the Hierarchy window choose object, and then "SuperLevelOptimizer/CreatePrefab".

Flag in the field "GroupingWithoutCombine" means that objects will be classified by materials without combining.

Flag in the field "SuperOptimization" means that level optimization will increase but the level of quality of textures at models will decrease.
